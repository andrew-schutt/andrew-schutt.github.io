  <p>Hello! My name is Andrew Schutt. I am a Software Engineer in central Iowa working for <a href="https://leantechniques.com/">Lean Techniques</a> currently. At Lean Techniques my focus has been working digial moderization efforts for clients. You can see my full experience on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/schuttandrew">LinkedIn</a>.
    This website serves as a place for me to consolidate thoughts and share work.</p>
  <h2>Speaking</h2>
  <p>
    Sharing knowledge and ideas is a fundamental idea of software engineering and what drew me into the field. My
    career is built on the generosity of close friends to complete strangers sharing knowledge. To give back I have given
    multiple talks seen here on <a href="https://slides.com/boots">Slides.com</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Bicycling</h2>
  <p>
    Bicycling is my preferred way to stay in shape and commute. No matter if it's snowy and freezing or sweltering and
    boiling. From long endurance rides to single track; it's all a good time. Come check me out on

  <h2>Tunes</h2>
  <p>
    Always trying to find and listen to new music. My favorite online radio is <a hreft="https://somafm.com">SomaFM</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Beer</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy a beer (especially after cycling). Discovering new breweries is a favorite pastime. We are lucky here in Iowa
    we have selection of high quality brewery options to drop into. Here is my <a href="https://untappd.com/user/andrew-schutt">Untappd</a>
