  <p>Hello! My name is Andrew Schutt. I am a Software Engineer in central Iowa you can see my experience on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/schuttandrew">LinkedIn</a>. This website serves as a place for me to consolidate and share thoughts or work.</p>
  <h2>Speaking</h2>
  <p>
    Sharing knowledge and ideas is one of the fundamental pieces of software development that drew me into the field. My
    career is built on the generosity of close friends to complete strangers sharing knowledge. To give back I have given
    multiple talks seen here on <a href="https://slides.com/boots">Slides.com</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Bicycling</h2>
  <p>
    Bicycling is my preferred way to stay in shape and commute. No matter if it's snowy and freezing or sweltering and
    boiling. From long endurance rides to single track it's all fun. Come check me out on

  <h2>Tunes</h2>
  <p>
    Always trying to find and listen to new music. My favorite online radio is <a hreft="https://somafm.com">SomaFM</a>. You can
    checkout what I am listening to here at
    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/teul8rysv075nzkcevk3nlh3y?si=BNfuB4lESHW172QZvAFeZA">Spotify</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Beer</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy a beer (especially after cycling). Discovering new breweries is a favorite pastime. We are lucky here in Des
    Moines with a bunch of high quality options to choose from. Here is my <a href="https://untappd.com/user/andrew-schutt">Untappd</a>
