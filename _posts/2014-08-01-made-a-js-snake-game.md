**NOTE:**This was one of the first things I ever created on the web and is also an old post from 2014 according to the [repo history](https://github.com/cartothemax/snakejs/tree/master).

I followed along with a guide on this from Andres Pagella [here](http://www.andrespagella.com/snake-game).  The guide covers the basics of using the canvas tag and was a good introduction for me.
