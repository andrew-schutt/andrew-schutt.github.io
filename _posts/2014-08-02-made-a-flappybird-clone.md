**NOTE:**This was one of the first things I ever created on the web and is also an old post from 2014 according to the [repo history](https://github.com/cartothemax/snakejs/tree/master).

Came across this powerful Javascript library that helps you create 2D games called Phaser. A [short guide](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game) on the Phaser site will help get you started.

Using the library I was able to create my own clone of flappy bird. My high score was 8. I like to think my version is a little more challenging then the iPhone version!
