I enjoy finding new productivity tools espcially when they are CLI based. This little gem of a tool helps to navigate around your machine. Like any good tool it makes you feel like a wizard as you zoom around directories.

## z Jump Around

[z](https://github.com/rupa/z)

Linked above here is the tool that allows for fast and easy navigation across your system. Typing out `z <directory>` will "jump" you to that directory based on recent and frequent locations that are visited.

At first glance this seems to be fairly underwhelming functionality, but if you install it you will quickly find yourself integrating it and becoming dependent.

## ZSH-z

[zsh-z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z)

Thankfully a `zsh` implementation exists that I am easily able to install!

Here is a short snippet of it in action.
