Fundamentally Ruby works by invoking methods on objects. Everything in Ruby is an [Object](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Object.html). This includes [Boolean](https://www.rubytapas.com/2019/01/08/boolean/) by means of `TrueClass` and `FalseClass` classes.

But what about the method `puts`? This common method (message) is simply called without prefixing an object (receiver).

Here we create a simple variable and assign a value followed by invoking the `captialize` method on the `String`. Then this `puts` thing without any object and the name variable passed in as an argument.

```ruby
name = "andrew"
name.capitalize

puts name
```

## What object is this call happening on?

Any method call most occur on an object, so, what object is is the receiver for `puts`? Any time a receiver is missing the default object is "`self`"

## self

- Always references the "current object"
- Is the default receiver for method calls
- Changes depending on where you are

```ruby
puts self # => "main"
pus self.class # => "Object"
```

At the top level scope of a Ruby program is an object called `main` that we are seeing from `puts self`. This object is automatically used as the receiver for the method call when no explicit receiver is specified.

```ruby
puts self
```

is _effectively_ the same as...

```ruby
self.puts self # Note: this doesn't actually work...
```

Remember EVERY method is called on an object!
